	    This specification describes the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OAuth provides a method for making
	    authenticated HTTP requests using a token - an identifier used to denote an access grant
	    with specific scope, duration, and other attributes. Tokens are issued to third-party
	    clients by an authorization server with the approval of the resource owner. OAuth defines
	    multiple flows for obtaining a token to support a wide range of client types and user
	    experience.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        With the increasing use of distributed web services and cloud computing, third-party
        applications require access to server-hosted resources. These resources are usually
        private and require authentication using the resource owner's credentials (typically a
        username and password). In the traditional client-server authentication model, a client
        accessing a protected resource on a server presents the resource owner's credentials in
        order to authenticate and gain access.
      </t>
      <t>
        Resource owners should not be required to share their credentials when granting third-party
        applications access to their protected resources. They should also have the ability to
        restrict access to a limited subset of the resources they control, to limit access
        duration, or to limit access to the methods supported by these resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method for making authenticated HTTP requests using a token - an
        identifier used to denote an access grant with specific scope, duration, and other
        attributes. Tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the
        approval of the resource owner. Instead of sharing their credentials with the client,
        resource owners grant access by authenticating directly with the authorization server which
        in turn issues a token to the client. The client uses the token (and optional secret) to
        authenticate with the resource server and gain access.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        her private photos stored at a photo sharing service (resource server), without sharing her
        username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates directly with
        the photo sharing service (authorization server) which issues the printing service
        delegation-specific credentials (token).
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of OAuth with any other transport protocol than <xref target='RFC2616'>HTTP</xref>
        is undefined.

		      Clients interact with a protected resource, first by requesting access (which is granted
		      in the form of an access token) from the authorization server, and then by authenticating
		      with the resource server by presenting the access token. <xref target='Figure 1' />
		      demonstrates the flow between the client and authorization server (A, B), and the flow
		      between the client and resource server (C, D), when the client is acting autonomously
		      (the client is also the resource owner).

		      Access token strings can use any internal structure agreed upon between the authorization
		      server and the resource server, but their structure is opaque to the client. Since the
		      access token provides the client access to the protected resource for the life of the
		      access token, the authorization server should issue access tokens which expire within an
		      appropriate time, usually much shorter than the duration of the access grant.
		    </t>
		    <t>
	        When an access token expires, the client can request a new access token from the
	        authorization server by presenting its credentials again (<xref target='Figure 1' />), or
	        by using the refresh token (if issued with the access token) as shown in
	        <xref target='Figure 2' />. Once an expired access token has been replaced with a new
	        access token (A, B), the client uses the new access token as before (C, D).

	        This specification defines a number of authorization flows to support different client
	        types and scenarios. These authorization flows can be separated into three groups:
	        user delegation flows where the client is acting on behalf of an end user, end user
	        credentials flows where the client uses the end user's credentials directly to obtain
	        authorization, and autonomous flows where the client is acting for itself (the client is
	        also the resource owner).
	      </t>
	      <t>
	        Additional authorization flows may be defined by other specifications to cover different
	        scenarios and client types.
        </t>
	      <t>
		      The user delegation authorization flows defined by this specifications are:

		      <list style='symbols'>
			      <t>
              Web Callback Flow - This flow is optimized for cases where the client is part of a
              web server application. This flow is described in <xref target='web_callback_flow' />.
		        </t>
		        <t>
		          Native Application Flow - This flow is use by clients running as native code on the
		          end user's computer or device outside a user-agent. This flow is described in
		          <xref target='native_app_flow' />.
	          </t>
			      <t>
              User-Agent Flow - This flow is designed for clients running inside a user-agent
              (typically a web browser), and therefore cannot receive callbacks from the
              authorization server. This flow is described in <xref target='user_agent_flow' />.
		        </t>
			      <t>
              Device Flow - This flow suitable for clients executing on limited devices, but where
              the end user has separate access to a user-agent on another computer or device. This
              flow is described in <xref target='device_flow' />.

	        <list style='symbols'>
			      <t>
              Username and Password Flow - This flow is used in cases where the end user trusts
              the client to handle its credentials but it is still undesirable for the client to
              store the end user's username and password. This flow is described in
              <xref target='username_password_flow' />.
		        </t>

    <section title='Obtaining an Access Token' anchor='get_token'>
      <t>
        The client obtains an access token by using one of the authorization flows supported by the
        authorization server. The authorization flows all use the same authorization endpoint, each
        with a different set of request parameters and values.
      </t>
      <t>
        When issuing an access token, the authorization server MUST retain the scope, duration, and
        other access attributes granted by the resource owner, and enforce these restrictions when
        receiving a protected resource request made with the access token issued.
      </t>
      <t>
        In many cases it is desirable to issue access tokens with a shorter lifetime than the
        duration of the authorization grant. However, it is undesirable to require the resource
        owner to authorize the request again. Instead, the authorization server issues a refresh
        token in addition to the access token. When the access token expires, the client can
        request a new access token without involving the resource owner as long as the
        authorization grant is still valid. The token refresh method is described in
        <xref target='token_refresh' />.
      </t>

      <section title='Authorization Endpoint'>
        <t>
          The client obtains the URI of the authorization endpoint from the server's documentation,
          or by making an unauthorized protected resource request (from the
          <spanx style='verb'>WWW-Authenticate</spanx> response header
          <xref target='authz_uri_attribute'>authorization-uri</xref> attribute).
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization endpoint advertised by the server MUST NOT include a query or fragment
          components as defined by <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since requests to the authorization endpoint result in the transmission of plain text
          credentials in the HTTP request and response, the authorization server MUST require the
          use of a transport-layer mechanism such as TLS or SSL (or a secure channel with
          equivalent protections) when sending requests to the authorization endpoints.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Flow Parameters'>
        <t>
          Clients should avoid making assumptions about the size of tokens and other server-generated
          values, which are left undefined by this specification. Servers should document the
          expected size of any value they issue.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Client Credentials' anchor='client_id'>
	      <t>
		      When requesting access from the authorization server, the client identifies itself using
		      its authorization-server-issued client credentials. The client credentials include a
		      client identifier and an OPTIONAL symmetric shared secret. The means through which the
		      client obtains these credentials are beyond the scope of this specification, but usually
		      involve registration with the authorization server.
		    </t>
		    <t>
	        The client identifier is used by the authorization server to establish the identity of
	        the client for the purpose of presenting information to the resource owner prior to
	        granting access, as well as for providing different service levels to different clients.
	        They can also be used to block unauthorized clients from requesting access.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		      Due to the nature of some clients, authorization servers SHOULD NOT make assumptions
		      about the confidentiality of client credentials without establishing trust with the
		      client operator. Servers SHOULD NOT issue client secrets to the client incapable or
		      keeping their secrets confidential.
		    </t>
	    </section>

      <section title='User Delegation Flows'>
	      <t>
		      User delegation flows are used to grant client access to protected resources by the
		      end user without sharing the end user credentials (typically a username and password)
		      with the client. Instead, the end user authenticates directly with the authorization
		      server, and grants client access to its protected resources.
		    </t>
		
        <section title='Web Callback Flow' anchor='web_callback_flow'>
          <t>
            The web callback flow is a user delegation flow suitable for clients capable of
            interacting with the end user's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of
            receiving callback requests from the server (capable of acting as an HTTP server).

            The native application flow is a user delegation flow suitable for client applications
            running as native code on the end user's computer or device (i.e. executing outside a
            browser). The client is capable of interacting with the end user's user-agent but is
            incapable of receiving callback requests from the server (incapable of acting as an
            HTTP server).
          </t>
          <t>
            The native application flow is similar to the
            <xref target='web_callback_flow'>web callback flow</xref> but instead of using a
            callback to deliver the verification code to the client, the authorization server
            displays the verification code to the end user via its user-agent. If the client is
            able to interact with the user-agent, it retrieves the verification code automatically.
            Otherwise, the end user manually enters the verification code into a client dialog.
          </t>
          <t>
            This flow does not utilize the client secret since the client code resides on the end
            user's computer or device which makes the client secret accessible and exploitable.
            Because the client is incapable of receiving callbacks, the access token is encoded
            into the HTML response which exposes it to the end user and other applications residing
            on the computer or device.

		          <t>
			          The native application client initiates the flow by opening a user-agent on the end

			        <t>
				        The authorization server authenticates the end user (via the user-agent) and

			        </t>
			        <t>
				        Assuming the end user granted access, the authorization server display the

			        </t>
			        <t>
				        The client interacts with the user-agent and obtains the verification code from the
				        title of the web page displayed by the user-agent. If the client is unable to
				        interact with the user-agent, the end user manually copies the verification code from
				        the user-agent into an interface provided by the client.

              In order for the end user to grant the client access, the client sends the end user
              to the authorization server. The client constructs the request URI by adding the
              following URI query parameters to the user authorization endpoint URI:

              The client launches a user-agent on the end user's computer or device, and directs it

                For example, the client directs the end user's user-agent to make the

              authorization, including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS/SSL, is beyond
              the scope of this specification. However, the server MUST first verify the

          <t>
            The user-agent flow is a user delegation flow suitable for client applications residing
            in a user-agent, typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as
            JavaScript. The client is capable of interacting with the end user's user-agent but is
            incapable of receiving callback requests from the server (incapable of acting as an
            HTTP server).
          </t>
          <t>
            Instead of receiving callbacks, the client requests the authorization server to
            redirect the user-agent to another web server or local resource accessible to the
            browser which is capable of extracting the access token from the response and passing
            it to the client.
          </t>
          <t>
            This user-agent flow does not utilize the client secret since the client code
            resides on the end user's computer or device which makes the client secret accessible
            and exploitable. Because the client is incapable of receiving callbacks, the access
            token is encoded into the redirection URI which exposes it to the end user and other
            applications residing on the computer or device.

		          <t>
		            The client sends the user-agent to the authorization server and includes its client

	            <t>
				        The authorization server authenticates the end user (via the user-agent) and

			        <t>
				        Assuming the end user granted access, the authorization server redirects the

              <t>
                The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a request to the web

            The device flow is a user delegation flow suitable for clients executing on devices
            which do not have an easy data-entry method (e.g. game consoles or media server), but
            where the end user has separate access to a user-agent on another computer or device
            (e.g. home computer, a laptop, or a smartphone). The client is incapable of receiving
            callback requests from the server (incapable of acting as an HTTP server).
          </t>
          <t>
            Instead of interacting with the end user's user-agent, the client instructs the end
            user to use another computer or device and connect to the authorization server to
            approve the access request. Since the client cannot receive callbacks, it polls the
            authorization server repeatedly until the end user completes the approval process.
          </t>
          <t>
            This device flow does not utilize the client secret since the client code
            resides on a local device which makes the client secret accessible and exploitable.

              The client displays the user verification code and the user authorization URI to the
              end-user, and instructs the end user to visit the URI using a user-agent and enter
              the user verification code.
            </t>
            <t>
              The end user manually types the provided URI and authenticates with the authorization
              server. The way in which the server authenticates the end user (e.g. username and
              password login, OpenID, session cookies) and in which the server obtains the end
              user's authorization, including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS/SSL, is
              beyond the scope of this specification. However, the server MUST first verify the
              identity of the end user.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server prompts the end user to authorize the client's request by
              entering the user verification code provided by the client. Once the end user
              approves or denies the request, the authorization server informs the end user to
              return to the device for further instructions.

              Since the client is unable to receive callbacks from the authorization server, it

              The client makes the following request at an arbitrary but reasonable interval which
              MUST NOT exceed the minimum interval rate provided by the server (if present via the
              <spanx style='verb'>interval</spanx> parameter). Alternatively, the client MAY
              provide a user interface for the end user to manually inform it when authorization

      <section title='End User Credentials Flows'>
	      <t>
		      End user credential flows are used to grant client access to protected resources by the
		      end user directly sharing the end user credentials (typically a username and password)
		      with the client. Unlike user delegation flows, end user credentials flows require a much
		      higher degree of trust between the client and end user.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		      These flows are suitable in cases where the end user already has a trust relationship
		      with the client, such as its computer operating system or highly privileged applications.
		      Servers SHOULD take special care when enabling user credentials flows, and SHOULD only do
		      so when other delegation flows are not viable.
		    </t>
	      <t>
		      However, unlike the HTTP Basic authentication scheme defined in
		      <xref target='RFC2617' />, the end user's credentials are used in a single request and
		      are exchanged for an access token and refresh token which eliminates the client need to
		      store them for future use.
	      </t>

        <section title='Username and Password Flow' anchor='username_password_flow'>
          <t>
            The username and password flow is an end user credentials flow suitable for clients
            capable of asking end users for their usernames and passwords. It is also used to
            migrate existing clients using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or
            Digest authentication to OAuth by converting the end user credentials stored with
            tokens.
          </t>
          <t>
            The methods through which the client prompts end users for their usernames and
            passwords is beyond the scope of this specification. The client MUST discard the
            usernames and passwords once an access token has been obtained.

	      <t>
		      Autonomous client flows are used to grant client access to protected resources controlled
		      by the client (i.e. the client is the resource owner). For example, these flows are
		      useful when a service provides both client-specific resources in addition to end user
		      resources.

        <section title='Client Credentials Flow' anchor='client_credentials_flow'>

            The client credentials flow is used when the client acts autonomously without acting on
            behalf of a separate resource owner. The client secret is assumed to be high-entropy
            since it is not designed to be memorize by an end user.

    <section title='Accessing a Protected Resource' anchor='access_resource'>
      <t>
        OAuth 2.0 supports the ability for clients to make protected resource requests by using
        TLS/SSL (<xref target='using_ssl' />) and/or by signing their HTTP request with shared
        secrets (<xref target='using_signatures' />). Protected resources MUST support clients
        making authenticated requests via TLS/SSL (<xref target='using_ssl' />). Protected
        resources MAY also choose to also support signatures (<xref target='using_signatures' />),
        and it is RECOMMENDED that clients make signature-based authenticated requests via TLS/SSL.
      </t>
      <t>
        If a client includes more than one access token within the request, the protected resource
        MUST respond with a HTTP 400 'Bad Request' error code.
      </t>

      <section title='Bearer Token Requests' anchor='using_ssl'>
        <t>
          When using TLS/SSL, clients MUST present an access token to authenticate to a protected
          resource. Use of the HTTP 'Authorization' header field as defined by
          <xref target='RFC2617' /> is RECOMMENDED, since HTTP implementations are aware that this
          header has special security properties and may require special treatment in caches and
          logs. Protected resources SHOULD take precautions to ensure that access tokens are not
          inadvertently logged or captured. It is RECOMMENDED that clients verify the authenticity
          of the certificate provided when establishing a TLS/SSL connection to the protected
          resource.
